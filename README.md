# react-weather

This is a weather web application built on Node.js and React.js. The published version can be found at [https://rainey-weather.herokuapp.com/](https://rainey-weather.herokuapp.com/).

## Support

In addition to Node.js and React.js. This project is made possible by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home), [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Accessibility

Tested with NVDA and JAWS in Chrome and Firefox. Additional automated testing by axe browser dev tools. No major blockers found.

In future iterations, however, more detailed guidance and error messaging can be provided for the "Search for a location" field. A `<datalist>` is operable, but it's not clear to non-sighted users how to operate it.

## Notes

-   This application was cloned from [node-react-heroku](https://github.com/raineyf/node-react-heroku), a boilerplate project to create Node/React projects for Heroku. More information about local development and deployment can be found there.
